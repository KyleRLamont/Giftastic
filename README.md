## HTML/CSS
These components were really very basic. I wanted the website to be simple to showcase API usage with Giphy.

## Javascript and API
The meat of this assignment. Breaking this into different sections was truly the key to making this work, even though it appears really simple. First I had to make an array to hold preloaded animals. I wanted some prebuilt options so the user would have a feel for what they were going to be doing. Then I had to pull each item out of the area and make a button for it with the appropriate value. After that, I had to add a feature that took the value from the text field and added a new button and item to the array.

Once that was done, then I used document listeners to make the buttons clickable and pull gifs related to their value from Giphy. The tricky part was making sure the giphy response was broken down correctly to pull the correct information (rating, still image, animated image). 

Finally, added another document listener to make each gif clickable, causing them to animate.
